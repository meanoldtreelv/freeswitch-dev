# FreeSWITCH Development Notes

### Backend Solutions
There are multiple backends that will be needed to scale FreeSWITCH to enterprise levels.
These are discussed in ~/backends.md

### Feature Buildout
Since we are building a FreeSWITCH solution from scratch each of the modules will need to be explicitly built and configured. This will let us create and tune a feature set that is designed for our customer base.
The scope of features to be provided, and the modules needed to accomodate them are discussed in ~/modules/*
